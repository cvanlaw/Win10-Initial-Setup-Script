## Description

Forked from: <https://github.com/Disassembler0/Win10-Initial-Setup-Script>
Adjusted defaults for personal use.

This is a PowerShell script for automation of routine tasks done after fresh installations of Windows 10. This is by no means any complete set of all existing Windows tweaks and neither is it another "antispying" type of script. It's simply a setting which I like to use and which in my opinion make the system less obtrusive.

This repository has been originaly created as complementary to article https://www.dasm.cz/clanek/jak-z-windows-10-udelat-desktopovy-system (written in czech) which explains the respective snippets a bit more in detail. The article was last updated on 2016-08-15 and will not be updated further. All development and discussion has been moved here.

## Usage
If you just want to run the script with default preset, simply right click on the *Win10.ps1* file, choose *Run with PowerShell*, and confirm execution policy change. Make sure your account is a member of Administrators group as the script attempts to run with elevated privileges.

### Advanced usage
The script supports customized presets where you can specify which tweaks should be applied. You can either pass the function names directly as parameters.  
`powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File Win10.ps1 EnableFirewall EnableDefender`

Or you can create a file where you write the function names (one function per line) and then pass the filename using *-preset* parameter. Don't forget that the script will try to run with elevated privileges and will use different working directory, therefore use of absolute paths is recommended.  
`powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File Win10.ps1 -preset D:\Install\mypreset.txt`

## FAQ

**Q:** Can I run the script safely?  
**A:** Definitely not. You have to understand what the functions do and what will be the implications for you if you run them. Some functions lower security, hide controls or uninstall applications. **If you're not sure what the script does, do not attempt to run it!**

**Q:** Can I run the script repeatedly?  
**A:** Yes! In fact the script has been written to support exactly this as it's not uncommon that big Windows Updates reset some of the settings.

**Q:** Did you test the script?  
**A:** Yes. I'm testing new additions on up-to-date Home and Enterprise editions in VMs. I'm also regularly using it for all my home installations after all bigger updates.

**Q**: I've run the script and it did xxx, how can I undo it?  
**A:** For every tweak, there is also a corresponding function which restores the default settings. Use them to create and run new preset. Alternatively, since most functions are just automation for actions which can be done using GUI, find appropriate control and modify it manually.

**Q:** I've run the script and it broke my computer / killed neighbor's dog / caused world war 3.  
**A:** I don't care. Also, that's not a question.

**Q:** I'm using a tweak for xxx on my installation, can you add it?  
**A:** Submit a PR or drop me a message. If I find the functionality simple, useful and not dependent on any 3rd party modules or executables, I might add it.

**Q:** Can I use the script or modify it for my / my company's needs?  
**A:** Sure, knock yourself out. Just don't forget to include copyright notice as per MIT license requirements. I'd also suggest including a link to this github repo as it's very likely that something will be changed, added or improved to keep track with future versions of Windows 10.

**Q:** Why are there repeated pieces of code throughout some functions?  
**A:** So you can directly take the function block and use it elsewhere, without elaborating on any dependencies.

**Q:** For how long are you going to maintain the script?  
**A:** As long as I use Windows 10.
